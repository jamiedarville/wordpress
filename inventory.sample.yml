# This file is used by Ansible to define the hosts that the playbook
# will perform actions on. Below is the sample inventory provided by
# this playbook which includes inline comments clarifying each section
# and the items contained within it.

# The 'wordpress' group contains the variables and hosts that will be
# used by the playbook to deploy WordPress.
wordpress:
  # Within the 'wordpress' group we may define 'vars' that act as
  # settings that apply to all 'hosts' defined in this group.
  vars:
    # When enabled, 'use_ultrastack' signals to also include Nginx and
    # Redis as part of the deployment.
    use_ultrastack: true

    # When enabled, 'use_letsencrypt' signals to generate a Let's Encrypt
    # SSL certificate as part of the deployment. This is disabled by default
    # to prevent a host from being ratelimited by the Let's Encrypt API,
    # though additional conditions have been added to ensure that a
    # host meets the needed conditions to generate an SSL.
    #
    # You may freely enable/disable this variable to control whether a
    # target site should use HTTP or HTTPS after running this playbook.
    use_letsencrypt: false

  # Within the 'wordpress' group we may define 'hosts' that indicate
  # the individual deployment targets for this playbook.
  hosts:
    # Within 'hosts' we may define an individual host, referenced in
    # this example as 'domain.tld'. This may be either a domain name
    # or IP address, based on your preference, provided it is able to
    # be reached.
    domain.tld:

      # 'system_user' refers to the Linux system user that the
      # WordPress installation will be owned by and created under this
      # user's '~/doc_root' directory.
      system_user: "wordpress"

      # The domain associated with the WordPress installation. Simply
      # use the domain name itself without defining a protocol or
      # trailing '/' characters.
      site_domain: "domain.tld"

      # The email address of the WordPress administrator.
      site_email: "user@domain.tld"

      # The username of the WordPress administrator.
      site_user: "example_username" # INSECURE!! CHANGEME!!

      # The password of the WordPress administrator.
      site_pass: "example_password" # INSECURE!! CHANGEME!!
